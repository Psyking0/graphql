# 🚀 GraphQL 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a client-side rendered Single Page Application (SPA) built using **Vanilla JavaScript** that communicates with a **GraphQL** API. Its main purpose is to help you learn how to query data with GraphQL and build a dynamic UI based on user-specific data — your **personal profile dashboard**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Learn and implement GraphQL queries (basic, nested, and with arguments)
- ✅ Authenticate using a JWT and interact with the GraphQL API
- ✅ Build a responsive, clean profile UI using Vanilla JS
- ✅ Create at least **two SVG-based statistics graphs**
- ✅ Host the app publicly (e.g. Netlify or GitHub Pages)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **JavaScript** (Vanilla, No Frameworks)
- **HTML/CSS**
- **SVG** (for stats visualization)
- **GraphQL** (as the data layer)
- **JWT Authentication**
- **Netlify** (or similar for deployment)

---

## 🧪 Local Development Setup

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm installed
- An internet connection
- Your platform credentials to get the JWT

---

### ▶️ Running Locally

Use the `serve` CLI to emulate Netlify-style SPA routing:

```bash

npx serve -s .
